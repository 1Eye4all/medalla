# Lighthouse Config for Schlesi v0.11
This document describes how to connect to and participate in the Schlesi testnet using the Lighthouse ETH2 client. [github.com/sigp/lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse)

### Requirements
This requires Rust, of course, get it here: [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)

To connect to Schlesi v0.11, you would have to compile Lighthouse from `master` branch.

```
git checkout master
```

Make sure to build in release mode.

```
cargo build --release
```

### Beacon Node
If you have the latest `master` of Lighthouse, the beacon node will default to Schlesi testnet. No further configuration required!

If you plan to run a validator on Schlesi, enable the Rest API with ` --http`:

```
lighthouse bn --http
```

### Validator Deposits
The validator contract is deployed on Goerli testnet address [0xA15554BF93a052669B511ae29EA21f3581677ac5](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xA15554BF93a052669B511ae29EA21f3581677ac5).

Assuming you have a Goerli node running on localhost with RPC enabled on port `8545`, this will create valiadtor keys and send a deposit:

```
lighthouse account validator new \
--send-deposits \
--password ./password.txt \
--deposit-value 32000000000 random
```

Make sure your `./password.txt` contains the password for your first Goerli testnet account (`eth.accounts[0]`) which has sufficient funds (> 32 GÃ¶ETH).

It's recommended to use a Geth node as ETH1 provider.

### Validator Client
To start validating, open another terminal and launch the validator client:

```
lighthouse vc
```

Please create an issue if this does not work. We will figure it out: [github.com/goerli/schlesi/issues/new](https://github.com/goerli/schlesi/issues/new)
